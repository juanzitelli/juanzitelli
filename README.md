# Juan Agustín Zitelli
### Software engineering student @ UAI && Research and development intern @ CAETI, UAI

🔭 I’m currently working on **Lawful**, a C# UWP app that will allow teams, organisations, or whatever group of people working collaboratively to make decisions together and propose, vote, and comment iniciatives for everyday's work and the future ✨. [Repo here](https://github.com/GianElli99/Lawful)

🌱 I’m currently learning **MERN**, my favorite javascript stack! (I'm into React the most tho')

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects oriented to improve university student's productivity.
