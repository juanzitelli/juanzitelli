## Motivation

> Shipping quality software is hard. That’s why I strongly believe that collaboration is a key factor to achieve business goals and I’m the kind of developer who thrives at communicating ideas both through advice and code (mostly TypeScript). I also love the english language (🇬🇧) quite as much as I love programming.

## Interests

- Web vitals and performance optimizations.
  - For these topics I very much fancy tools like SvelteKit and Remix.
- Databases design.
  - Personally I’m a big SQL fan but learning how to scale no-SQL databases would be exciting.
- Client/Server architecture strategies.
  - I would be thrilled to learn more about good architectural practices/patterns.
