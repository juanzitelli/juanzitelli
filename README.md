## Motivation

> Shipping quality software is hard. That’s why I strongly believe that collaboration is a key factor to achieve business goals and I’m the kind of developer who thrives at communicating ideas both through advice and code (mostly TypeScript). I also love the english language (🇬🇧) quite as much as I love programming.
